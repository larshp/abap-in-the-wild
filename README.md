https://larshp.github.io/abap-in-the-wild/

Enter the lands of open source ABAP, discover new tools, learn how to survive the empty plains of continuous integration. We will guide you through the jungle, hopefully to discover the everlasting temple of ABAP.
After the journey, your backpack will be filled with open source multi tools like abapGit, abaplint, git, and youâ€™ll know how and where to start your next ABAP open source experience.
